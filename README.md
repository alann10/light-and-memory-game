## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used youtube videos, I cant rememeber the exact ones I used]


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I tried to add a spotify api in which the user would be able to log in and play any song while they play unfortunately, it was difficult 
to get the api to work. However, music playing in the background still sounded like a great idea. So i decided to add a feature in which 
one song is able to play and pause on the users liking! ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I want to know more about apis and how to implement them in my code.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would like to change the front end to work better on phone instead of just working well on computers. ]
[ Also look back on my code to simplify it and have a better runtime.]
[Lastly, i would like to get the spotify api working.]
